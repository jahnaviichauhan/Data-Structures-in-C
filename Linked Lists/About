 Linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
 In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
 
 Like arrays, a Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are 
 linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
 
 Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
-Dynamic Array.
-Ease of Insertion/Deletion.
-Insertion at the beginning is a constant time operation and takes O(1) time, as compared to arrays where inserting an element at the beginning takes O(n) 
time,where n is the number of elements in the array.


// A linked list node in C
struct Node
{
	int data;
	struct Node* next;
};
